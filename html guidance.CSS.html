			The best thing about using HTML is the fact that you can give back to other people.
		 	That will not be able to recieve such help. 
			For instance if you control the SOURCE CODE given to you in one of the lesson in the document. Above it will make things easier. 
			What I have learned is to use what have been given to you. ensure that it is converted merely to the interne (GOOGLE) . Or other search engine. 
			Seeing a Good video will make it clearer to program in HTML. 
	
			The internet provider should be available to get you a connection. Through NOTEPAD. 
			you such win at designing webpage you desire.

		<p2> 
			Navigating to websites has become a lot cheaper and smarter. you will need other gadgets to make it faster, so that it runs with incredile spread. 
			The internet was desing to bring together people from all other the world as a way to communicate inspite the reach. 
			Lets say if I was located in London but had to call someone, I can't so I will us the internet, 
			powered by the smarts satelit system to guide my signal to a new place in New England Australia.
			 I have language that NASA release satelites to SPACE,
			 to send even powerful signal much like a power plant sends millions of volts to a transformer. But instead its in a deep UNKNOWN.  
			WHY? because I have to talk to someone COUNTRY I don't understand. </p2>
			<br>
			<h1>Continuing ON. </h1>
		<p2> 

			The Speed of LIGHT is involved however listen closely...., It is the satellites reflective ARMS that sends signals too NEW ENGLAND.
			 But the AUZies are just as HARD to understand as the Scots.
			 Not to Dethrone their Freedom, 
			Its merely my love to send a please don't buy the BOUNTY chocolates from the SNOKIE SHOP. Unfortunately in my underpants. 
		</p2>

			<h2> Connection </h2>

		<p2>
			I have learned a lot about html from the online clip store thats free to use only with a proper wifi connection. YouTube also sends signals to audiences all over the world for a chance to 
			believe that they can too contribute to the vast open worldwideweb. But follow there instruction such as HTML5 full course you will create a simple well uniformed.
			webpage for yourselve or anyone that wants it. Don't worry about how it looks it will improve later on. Trust yourselve and move on. 

			Javascript is good for many people that are prefect users of HTML and CSS, combines the two to be a lot neater and impressive. The progromming language is still the same 
			but you can build further on it. 

			EXAMPLE
				<img src:"........" >

			Try this. 


		</p2>
			<h2> </h2>
		<p2>
			CSS is cutomising the webpage full potentional and its unique creativity. 
			<h2> </h2>

			PYTHON is adding special effects in the webpage. 
			<br>
				
			C++ develops the webgame to be played by other users from other parts of the world. Its wonderful
			<br>
			JAVASCRIPT is messy. 
			<br>
			RUBY is unheard of before but hilarious. 
			<br>
		</p2>	
			<br>
		<p2>
			Programming platform sound interesting but are special for a little while. Be ashamed if you get bored and find a new one.
			
			1)  CodeBlock
			<br>
			2) Visual Studio Editor
			<br>
			3) Notepad
			<br>
			4) Github (Good Game)
			<br>
		</p2>

			<br>

			<br>

		</p2>
			<br>
		<p1>
			If you want to stream information llike live music or movie that you store from DVD you had, I would. 
			Download the DVD into the storage of you computer or laptop, then when you open your webpage use the video html code and add it to the 
			code where the location of the dvd is, to provide stream services like Netflix or Amazon movies. 

			<h3>EXAMPLE </h3>
				<img src: " upload a code of video html">
			<h2></h2>
			
			This is CSS all together. Have fun and its easy as pie. Juicy.

			<h2> </h2>

		<h3> Enjoy! </h3>
